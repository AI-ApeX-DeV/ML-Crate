## **Conclusions:** ##

* Most of the Machine Learning Learners and Professionals are from Nigria.

* So we can say that Nigerians are much more active in ML than the rest of the world

* Most of them are following someone and they also have the high number of people following them.

* Some of them have huge followers but not following anyone.

* There are many ML users in Github.
