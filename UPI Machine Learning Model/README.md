### Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model with highest accuracy, which will predict the UPI Payments trend.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project is taken from the Kaggle dataset website. Here is the link for the dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/bhatnagardaksh/upipaymentsindia

### What Have I Done?
- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizing different aspects of the dataset.
- Finding number of observations and outliers in the dataset.
- Plotting different attributes of the dataset.
- Applying different Machine Learning algorithms for the Model Creation.
  - Split the dataset into 80:20 ratio for training and testing purpose.
  - Logistic Regression deployment.
  - Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm deployment.
  - Random Forest Classifier Algorithm deployment.
  - Linear Regression Algorithm Deployment
- Create the Model using the best fitted algorithm.

### Libraries used:
1. numpy.
2. pandas.
3. matplotlib.
4. seaborn.
5. sklearn.

### Visualization and EDA of different attributes:
