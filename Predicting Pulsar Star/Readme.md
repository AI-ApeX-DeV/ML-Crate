WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
2. Then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
3. data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
4. finally 4 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm 
5. also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms

MODELS USED

1. Random Forest
2. KNN
3. GNB
4. Decision Tree

LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-Learn


CONCLUSION

We can conclude that DECISION TREE gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
