 ### Conclusion:

   - So we can say that around the same time frame at first Kendall Jenner was most searched then Kourtney Kardashian then Khole Kardashian then Kim Kardashian was searched then after that Kim Kardashian Search was increased and the others were decreasing but not that much.
   - This shows that at first, Kim Kardashian was not that much searched and Kylie Jenner was most searched then both of them fell down in searches after reaching their peak searches.
