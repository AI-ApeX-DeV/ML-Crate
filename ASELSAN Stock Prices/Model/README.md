## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the stock prices of ASELSAN, a leading defense technology company in Turkey.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zlemglsmklkaya/aselsan-stock-prices-20172022).

## Project Progress

Here's a breakdown of what has been accomplished so far:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Exploration**: 
   - Imported necessary libraries and the dataset.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
   - Identified outliers and examined the distribution of various attributes.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Visualized different aspects of the dataset using plots and charts.
   - Explored the variation of ASELSAN's opening price over time.
   - Utilized heatmap to understand correlations between features.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Developed a machine learning model for predicting ASELSAN stock prices.
   - Evaluated the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

## Libraries Used

1. numpy: For numerical computing.
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
4. seaborn: For enhancing the aesthetics of plots.
5. sklearn: For machine learning tasks.
