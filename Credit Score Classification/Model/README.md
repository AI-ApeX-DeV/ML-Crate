Credit Score Classification
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

AIM : Classify the credit scores of different customers.

DATASET : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification

GOAL : Implementtion of different algorithms like Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier to see which gives better accuracy.

DESCRIPTION: The main aim of the project is to use 3-4 algorithms to implement the models and compare all the algorithms to find out the best fitted algorithm for the model by checking the accuracy score.

WORK DONE:
• Analyzed the data and found insights such as Importing the Dependencies,Data Analysis,Splitting the data into training data & Test data,Handling the Missing values Converting the Category into numeric,Building the Model

• Next trained model with algorithms:

  o	Logistic Regression
  
  o	Random Forest Classifier
  
  o	KNeighbors Classifier
  
  o	Decision Tree Classifier
  
•	Importing the Test Data,Predicting the Values from Models

•	In this RandomForestClassifier performed the best with 100% accuracy

LIBRARIES NEEDED:
Numpy,
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
scikit-learn,
seaborn

CONCLUSION:

We investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features, and understanding the relationship between different features. 
In this RandomForestClassifier performed the best with 100% accuracy.
