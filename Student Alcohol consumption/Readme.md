**GOAL**

Perform exploratory data analysis on the Alcohol consumption by students and try to figure out the effect on grades of students uing Predictive Analysis and Machine Learning.

**DATASET**
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption

## Description

* First imported all the necessary libraries that are listed in the libraries section.
* Viewed the dataset's head and tail column.
* Extracted the general information.
* Described the statistical data.
* Grouped and compared some of the important columns with the average as a statstical parameter.
* Extracted the categorical and continuous columns.
* Took out all the important columns and encoded categorical variables.
* Created a new dataset from the previous one and added encoded the categorical columns.
* Selected the parameters x, y to train the model.
* Performed visualizations: 
    * Histogram
    * Normal Distribution
* Compared the columns with each other and view their result.

## Performed actions:
1. Data Cleaning: 
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data visualization
5. Separating the continuous and categorical variables

### Libraries Needed
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. Warnings (built in)

### IDE used: Jupyter Ntebooks

## Plots

### Distribution of Male and Female Students in the dataset

## CONCLUSION
1. The final G3 grade's prediction related to consideration of all the parameters is best when we use the Decision Tree Regressor model.
2. The DecisionTreeRegression model best fits the data for prediction as the Training Score is more as compared to other models.Â¶
