PIMA INDIANS DIABETES PREDICTION

GOAL

To predict whether a person is diabetic or not.

DATASET

Taken from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

DESCRIPTION

To see which classification model works good with this dataset for prediction of diabetes with provided details.

WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Data Extraction

      -> Importing the libraries
      -> Loaded the dataset
    
2. Data Exploration
  
      -> Knowing some of the statistical measures information
      -> Visualizing the data
      -> Correlation

3. Data Preparation
    
    -> Data Cleaning 
       
      i) Missing values
      ii) Outliers
      iii)variable type
      iv) format
       v) wrong value
  
4. Modeling
     
   -> Splitting the dataset
   -> Training the models
        Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes

5. Evaluation Metric

6. Predicting the output based on user's input

MODELS USED
   
   -Logistic Regression
   -Random Forest Classifier
   -Gaussian Naive Bayes

LIBRARIES NEEDED

   pandas
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   sklearn

ACCURACIES



CONCLUSION

According to ROC curve, Random forest is a good model to predict if a person is diabetic or not with a roc accuracy score of 0.729.
