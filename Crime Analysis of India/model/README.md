## Conclusion and Insights:
### General Insights
- The dataset didn't have any missing values meaning no random values were taken into consideration.
- A few insights like from ```.describe()``` and ```.info()``` are there is minimum of around 18.5k Total IPC (Indian Penal Code) Crimes which is a very pathetic situation.
- In district name ```TOTAL``` is, the sum of all the number of cases reported that 
year.
