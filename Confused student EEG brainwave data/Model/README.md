# Confused Student EEG prediction

## GOAL

The goal of this project is to perform EDA on the dataset and then to build a model to predict the student's eeg confusion.

## DATASET

The Dataset used for this project has been collected from kaggle website. The dataset contains demographic informations and eeg data of students.

The data is available at :- https://www.kaggle.com/wanghaohan/confused-eeg
## DESCRIPTION

This is just an exploratory data analysis and deep learning problem. I used pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to perform EDA on the dataset and then to build a model using tensorflow and keras to predict the student's eeg confusion.

## WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Performed EDA on the dataset
2. Visualized the data using subplots.
3. Found correlation using heatmap.
4. Built a model using tensorflow and keras.

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. Tensorflow
5. Keras
6. Scikit-learn

## CONCLUSION

We can conclude that the model is not very accurate but still useful. The model is moderately able to predict the student's confusion.
