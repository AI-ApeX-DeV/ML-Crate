# Email Spam Classifier

![interface](https://github.com/codewithpiyushh/ML-Crate/assets/154052068/1aa033f5-a27b-448a-872f-c52320c22930)

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that classifies emails as spam or not spam. It leverages Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn to train and evaluate various classification algorithms. The model aims to identify spam emails with high accuracy, protecting users from unwanted content.

## Technologies
Programming Language: Python 
Machine Learning Libraries:
scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/)
Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails. Each email is tagged as "spam" or "not spam" based on predefined criteria. The dataset should encompass a diverse range of email types to enhance model generalization.

## Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Remove irrelevant characters, HTML tags, etc.
Feature Engineering: Extract informative features from email content.
Normalization or Scaling: Ensure features are on a similar scale.
Splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
Algorithm Selection: Experiment with different classification algorithms, such as:

Naive Bayes (effective for text classification)
Support Vector Machines (strong for handling high-dimensional data)
Random Forest (robust to overfitting)
Others (consider exploring additional algorithms based on dataset characteristics)
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the chosen algorithms' hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Model Training
Train the selected model(s) on the training set.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, consider:

## Confusion Matrix: Visualize how well the model classifies emails.
ROC Curve: Assess the model's ability to discriminate between spam and legitimate emails.
False Positives and False Negatives: Analyze the types of emails the model misclassifies.
Usage
Instructions for running the model will depend on the specific implementation. It might involve providing an email or its content as input and receiving a classification result (spam or not spam).

## Deployment
For real-world use, consider deploying the model to integrate with an email client or server architecture for real-time spam filtering.
