Closes: #93 

### Describe the add-ons or changes you've made üìÉ
* Importing Keras, Tensorflow, mathplotlib and other libraries for the solution
* Creating the function that returns the VGG_16 model
* Importing the data, Splitting the dataset to Train and Test (Validation) data and normalising them.
* Training the model. (Uses Early Stopping for maximum accuracy and Adam as an optimizer)
* Plotting the accuracy and loss per epoch
* Random predictions of certain images
* Model produces Train Set Accuracy of 100% and Validation Set accuracy of 87.69

- [X] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)

## How Has This Been Tested? ‚öôÔ∏è

* The model was tested by splitting the Total Dataset into 2 : Training Data and Validation Data.
* The Model was verified with Validation Data
