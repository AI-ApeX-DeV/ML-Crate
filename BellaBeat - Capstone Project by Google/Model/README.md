**DESCRIPTION**

Brief description about the project

- I have done the exploratory data analysis of the dataset given. 

- And then used 4 models for find the best fitted model.


**MODELS USED**

- Linear Regression

- Logistic Regression

- Support Vector Machine

- KNN Classifier

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- Numpy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn 

- Scikit Learn

**VISUALIZATION**

INCLUSION OF IMAGES OF THE VISUALIZATION IS MUST (RESULT OF EDA).

**ACCURACIES**

**For TotalSteps vs Calories**


- Logistic Regression ~ 88.02%

- Support Vector Machine ~ 87.87%

- KNN Classifier ~ 84.40%

**For TotalSteps vs TotalActiveMinutesÂ¶**

- Logistic Regression ~ 79.57%

- Support Vector Machine ~ 80.00%

- KNN Classifier ~ 69.36%

**CONCLUSION**

Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine are the models that fitted the data really well.
