## **Conclusions:** ##
*	Year 2020 saw a massive fall in the NIFTY 50 index which is prominent in the graph above. The effect can be seen majorly when the first phase of the lockdown started.

* While the Delta variant spread there was not much fall in the stock market as complete lockdown was not imposed.

* Due to reduction in the number of the Coronavirus cases in India, a positive sentiment was generated which translated to gain in the NIFTY index.

* In 2020, all the sectoral indices were affected but as can be seen above, FMCG abd Pharma sector have started to rebound.
