## World Mortality Rate Analysis and Prediction
### Goal: Perform EDA and Predictive Analysis on the World Mortality datasets. 

### Datasets:
Download the dataset through given link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navinmundhra/world-mortality

### Description
The datasets contain the mortality rates of Adults and Infants. Also they have a brief numbers about:
1. Maternal mortality rate.
2. Infant Mortality rate.
3. Neonatal mortality rates (babies that die within 28 days of birth).

### Techniques performed on the dataset:
1. First cleaned each dataset
2. Described the general information about ht
3. Then filtered information from the columns
4. Converted the datatype of each column necessary
5. Performed visualization like:
      1. Bar plot
      2. Normal distribution
      3. Scatter plot
      4. Box plot

6. Treated the outliers if necessary
8. Then encoded the categorical variables
9. Separated the training and test variables
10. Implemented the Regressor and Classifier models
11. Calculated the evaluation metrics
12. Vislualized the stability using Normal Distribution
13. Dumped the models with a high training score

> Prepared the EDA reports for each dataset
 
### Models used:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regresor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
5. Decision Tree Classifier
6. Random Forest Classifier

### Libraries used
1. Pandas: Data reading, filtering, analysis and modelling
2. Pandas Profiling: Prepare Exploratory Data Analysis Reports (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandas-profiling)
3. Numpy: For scinetific computation
4. Scikit Learn: To implement various ML models
5. Seaborn: For advanced visualizations
6. Matplotlib: For linear and discrete visualizations

### Conclusion
Through the predictive analysis can say that the mortality rates have linearly decreased with years of time.
