**Milk Quality Prediction**

**GOAL**

Implementtion of classification algorithm to predict quality of milk.

**DATASET**

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cpluzshrijayan/milkquality

**WORK DONE**

Analyzed the data and found insights such as correlation, missing values and plotted different plots and compared them with pre and post covid times.
Next trained model with algorithms:
SVM

**MODELS USED**

RBF SVM : SVM performs well on classification problems when size of dataset is not too large. Support Vector Machine can also be used as a regression method, maintaining all the main features that characterize the algorithm (maximal margin).

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
seaborn

**Result and Conclusion**

The SVM classifier gives 91% accuracy to predict 3 classes of milk quality. After trying Naive Bayes classifier having 60% accuracy it was clear to go with the SVM as it is better and showing really good results.
