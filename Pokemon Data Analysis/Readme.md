## Title: Pokemon Dataset Analysis
## Goal: The aim of this project was to analyze the behavior of pokemon based upon its abilities and attack type.

## Dataset link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anatolinischakow/pokemon-data

## Techniques used:
1. Data Filtering
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Wrangling
4. Data Visualization

## Libraries used:
1. Pandas
2. Pandas profiling
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Numpy

## Visual Techniques used: 
1. Heatmap: For corelation check between the columns
2. KDE plot: A linear distribution for multiple parameters of a fataframe.
3. Box plot: For showing the least and highest growth of values.
4. Distribution plots: Plots that show the normal distribution of input data
5. Histogram: A continuous distribution of several parameters on different scale lengths
6. Scatter plot: For detecting outliers and distinct data points

## Conclusion
1. From the extracted information, created their dataframes and visualized their defence and attack parameters.
2. After that came across the conclusion that the pokemons with **higher healing powers and moderate or average attacking abilities are defensive in nature.**
3. While the pokemons with higher attack parameter values have a **high agression and less healing and defensive nature.**
