## Title: Pokemon Dataset Analysis
## Goal: The aim of this project was to analyze the behavior of pokemon based upon its abilities and attack type.

## Techniques used:

## Conclusion
1. From the extracted information, we created their dataframes and visualized their defence and attack parameters.
2. After that we came across the conclusion that the pokemons with higher healing powers and moderate or average attacking abilities are defensive in nature.
3. While the pokemons with higher attack parameter values have a high agression and less healing and defensive nature.
