## DESCRIPTION-

Main idea is to train a model that will predict ,which type /class of Chocolate is the onw which is asked to machine in form of a new data feed. Model in this project deal with the binary classified training dataset of the dark and white chocolate.

## WORK DONE

- Analysed and preprocessed the data by eliminating the files/data which is irrelevant o feed in the trainf/validation set.
- Did Data augmentation and to increase the training and validation set data.
- Trained a Convolutional Neural Network and fitted the dataset into it.

## LIBRARIES/FRAMEWORK NEEDED

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL
- TensorFlow

## PLOTS

## CONCLUSION

trying to use the CNN gave,
with the use of 3 outsourced test images, the model was able to predict the images with 100%, 100%, 98.41% confidence and accuracy.
